# Zoophile Mute List: Information & Evidence

## Table of contents

## Information

This moderation list for Bluesky is composed of zoophiles and people who actively interact with them, and this document with information and evidence is provided for transparency. View and subscribe to the list: <https://bsky.app/profile/heika.dog/lists/3k3eg23h7ko2i>.

To mute or block the accounts on the list, select "Subscribe" at the upper-right corner of the list page. When you subscribe to the list, accounts on the list will have a disclaimer below their profile that says they're muted or blocked by the list.

You can submit accounts to the list, request to be removed from the list, or submit feedback here: <https://zmlform.heika.dog>. To share this list, select the arrow to the right of the Subscribe button.

To be added to the list, candidates should meet at least one or more of these criteria:

1. Publicly identifying as a zoophile. This includes profiles with known coded dogwhistles like the zeta symbol (Œ∂), the triangles and four-pointed star (‚ó§‚ú¶‚ó¢), or the Phoenician aleph (ê§Ä), or having a handle that's linked to a zoophile-centric domain name like \*.zoo.wtf, \*.zoo.and.me, \*.zooey.pub, or \*.zoofurs.net.
2. Actively interacting with open zoophiles. This includes, but is not limited to: liking or reposting posts related to, replying to, or following a large number of open zoophiles.
3. Supporting or defending zoophiles or their associates, or creating spaces that welcome zoophiles.
4. Being publicly identified as a zoophile by a reputable whistleblower, or being found participating in conversations which advocate for or admit to zoophilic acts.

Some additional information:

- We don't add accounts to the list based on our own personal, subjective beliefs or standards. Suspicions, feelings that an account is "probably" eligible, or otherwise inferred judgements do not meet the aforementioned criteria for the list. Even if the mute list team is convinced someone is a zoophile or actively interacts with them, we don't add accounts unless we can present sufficient evidence.
- It's important to note that simply following or occasionally interacting with someone who was accused of being a zoophile is not enough to be added to the list. When it comes to accounts who are accused of actively interacting with zoophiles, we look for a clear, habitual pattern of one or more of the above criteria before we add them.
- We recognize that drawing or supporting feral NSFW isn't automatically condoning zoophilia, so we don't add feral NSFW artists or their supporters to the list unless there's evidence they are zoophiles or actively interact with them. Additionally, even though zoophiles continually use the label as a cover, we also apply this same sentiment to therians.
- "Known" zoophiles are people who were outed as zoophiles, while "open" zoophiles embrace the label‚Äîthese terms are not interchangeable.
- The mute list document occasionally sources from whistleblowers who specialize in reporting on zoophilia like ExposeTheFV and ConStaffWatch. We've gone on record to call these accounts "reputable whistleblowers," even carving out criteria in the list document for these accounts. The mute list team defines a "reputable" whistleblower as an account with a proven track record of gathering and presenting strong, verifiable evidence related to zoophiles, such as archived snapshots of websites or screenshots they take themselves. Additionally, whistleblowers we cite in the list document have demonstrated a nuanced understanding of paraphilias, accurately and reliably reporting on harmful individuals while also placing an emphasis on harm reduction. And, if and when they make an error-in-fact, they have also issued retractions.
- All relevant links to evidence are archived on <https://archive.today> in the event that they go down or change for any reason, we make a deliberate effort to capture our own high-quality screenshots instead of sourcing them from elsewhere.

These stipulations prevent innocent people from being unfairly put on the list, as we're aware these are serious accusations that can ruin a person's reputation and should not be taken lightly.

## Evidence

**Content warning:** Some of these links include censored, but still explicit animal sexual abuse media‚Äîproceed with caution.

1. (There were other furries in this thread, but I'll only be focusing on the people on the mute list with Bluesky accounts. Assume fully censored or blacked-out screenshots in the thread to be explicit animal sexual abuse media; these are not blank tweets.)

   - On July 2nd, 2023, Cael (@cael.tech/@murrsuit.ing), Abra Heron (@abra.anthro.place/@abra.sheath.pics), and Brick (@doggy.ws/@ad.doggy.ws) were all implicated in following and actively interacting with a zoophile, privated Twitter user @olHowlnGrowl. According to whistleblower @ExposeTheFV, this account only posts explicit animal sexual abuse media. (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675482183040131072>)
   - The zoophile in question directly encourages and supports animal sexual abuse, even going so far as to post a video of the act, a post which Brick was screenshotted liking on their AD. (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675482185586069504>) The year of the post is partially obscured in the original screenshot, but according to @ExposeTheFV in a separate reply, this video was posted on June 29th, 2023. (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1676923144089784321>)
   - Abra liked animal sexual abuse media with the caption "Huskies ‚ô• üåπ" (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675482187855175681>). Both Cael and Abra liked a post which, to put it delicately, applied a sexual innuendo represented by filling a donut with cream to animals at FWA 2023. (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675482190069760000>)
   - Cael liked a post from the zoophile complaining about "the account with the good dog dick photos" getting suspended.‚Äù (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675482190069760000>)
   - Linkin Monroe/Bad Doberman (@linkinmonroe.bsky.social) was seen following the same privated zoophile account that Cael, Abra, Brick, and Anubis Coyote were all interacting with: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675490129836912642>)

2. _[CW for realistic depictions of animal genitalia and explicit nudes. The Telegram link provided here also has screen recordings of select tweets in addition to screenshots.]_
   AkariHusky has a large amount of evidence against him, most of which can be viewed here if you have Telegram: (<https://t.me/AkariHuskyZoophile>) Along with directly supporting zoophilia and being an open zoophile for years, Akari also had an AD dedicated to his dog where he posted explicit animal sexual abuse media of the dog. In 2015, he said in a reply that he "wouldn't wish being zoo upon anyone," direct confirmation that he is a zoophile.
3. _[CW in the first link for explicit nudes and censored animal sexual abuse media.]_
   Among a mountain of other accusations like calling the act of holding people accountable for zoophilia an "SJW crusade" and liking a post on his AD which linked to a peer-to-peer mirror of animal sexual abuse media in 2013 (<https://twitter.com/itsjustathingy/status/1406230343426977793>), Cenny (@cenny.bsky.social/@cennyad.bsky.social) had the zeta symbol in his bio in 2016: (<https://twitter.com/cennyarchive/status/1566884973440811009>) and was caught liking explicit animal sexual abuse media on his AD (<https://twitter.com/cennyarchive/status/1566885691170197504>). In addition, he was explicitly mentioned as a zoophile in the zoosadism leaks in 2017: (<https://archive.today/zlA4O>).
4. Tarro (@tarro.zooey.pub) is an open zoophile. They were seen interacting with Akari: (<https://bsky.app/profile/tarro.zooey.pub/post/3k3cx4o7iz52h>).
5. Papa Rhino (@paparhino.dad/@papamord.bsky.social) is a zoophile. I worked on an outing about him with reputable whistleblower ExposeTheFV, linking him to his alt, JDonk (@zooeydonk.bsky.social), and showing he's a zoophile (and has publicly interacted with minors as young as 14): (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1730851018416771097>). He even liked a reply to JDonk's tweet _about_ JDonk being Rhino: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1730851024393691197>).
6. Soren (@soren.feral.moe) is an open zoophile.
7. Lukar (@lukar.feral.army) follows and interacts with open zoophiles: (<https://archive.ph/NNeP5>).
8. A Knotty Raccoon Girl (@kraccgurl.bsky.social) is an open zoophile.
9. Kaptain (@kaptain.dog) was found openly harboring zoophiles in a DM and called people holding zoophiles accountable "a witch hunt," in addition to interacting with Cenny's AD. (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1442165316608479232>).
10. Huskeee (@huskeee.bsky.social) and ZoobyDoobyDoo (@zoobydoobydoo.bsky.social) are both open zoophiles who requested to be put on the list: (1: <https://bsky.app/profile/huskeee.bsky.social/post/3k3pdbw7hvw2d> / 2: <https://bsky.app/profile/zoobydoobydoo.bsky.social/post/3k3txqk7kz72y>)
11. Zena O‚ÄôBrien/Liberty (@zenamobrien.bsky.social/@libertyfp.bsky.social) tweeted about wishing to have sex with a horse in 2021: (<https://bsky.app/profile/the984.bsky.social/post/3k3wp3usva62i>)
12. Akito (@akito.zooand.me) hosts a zoophile podcast and is an open zoophile: (<https://bsky.app/profile/akito.zooand.me/post/3k46ghzxyqs22>).
13. ~~ZooFur Faction (@zoo.pics) posts explicit images of IRL animal genitalia.~~ We‚Äôve gotten this account taken down. To anyone who reported them or shared a post calling for them to be reported, thank you! üéâ
14. 007bistromath (@007bistromath.bsky.social), Vex (@koolkanine.zooand.me), The Dog Queen (@interestedknot.bsky.social), Ceres Fallen (@ceresfallen.bsky.social), Akkuriss (@akkuriss.bsky.social), and Brass Bulldog (@brass.zooand.me) are all open zoophiles.
15. Tundru (@tundru.bsky.social) frequently interacts with Cenny, a known zoophile: (<https://twitter.com/Tundru_DireWolf/status/1406032710401892360>) and has been seen deflecting confrontations about the behavior of other known zoophiles to conversations about feral porn when the actual conversation is not strictly about that. For context: the user in question, while not having a Bluesky account that I‚Äôm aware of, commissioned porn of their dog being sexually abused by their OC. In this instance, this is distinguishable from normal feral porn because it explicitly referenced a real-life dog. (<https://twitter.com/Sweet_clawz/status/1620104867934273537>)
16. Milk (@championwhoops.zooand.me), Tarminac (@tarminac.bsky.social), Toggle (@toggle.zoo.wtf), Puppyboi (@st1ckyp4rts.bsky.social), Zedderchee (@zedderchee.bsky.social), Ginfossa (@ginfossa.bsky.social), and DotaWolf (@dotawolf.bsky.social) are all open zoophiles.
17. BirtyFur (@birtyfur.bsky.social) not only frequently draws profile picture commissions for zoophiles (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1684853358593798144>), but he‚Äôs also been seen following and interacting with them on Twitter as well: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1685040396236451840>).
18. Simba, the owner of furry community Discord server Furry Valley (@furryvalley.bsky.social), is a documented zoosadist: (<https://twitter.com/FENNERGY/status/1211658141701722112>) and has been documented following zoophiles on the main Furry Valley Twitter as recently as 2021: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1405775747818557442>). And it didn't take me long to find that they're still following zoophiles on the main Twitter account as of August 21st, 2023.
19. In a Telegram message from 2017, Rayne (no Bluesky account as of this writing; their Twitter is <https://twitter.com/FoxRayne13>) admitted to sexually abusing and killing live fish with their partner Teriyakii (@teriyaki.bsky.social) as ‚Äúa kink:‚Äù (<https://twitter.com/soulsmooothie/status/1693746660466135181>) Both have since privated their accounts. Video proof that the messages are real: (<https://twitter.com/soulsmooothie/status/1693905674227331228>)
20. Matuska (@matuska.bsky.social) has publicly stated they don't condone IRL zoophilia on their feral account, but they were seen listing themselves as a zoophile in 2019: (<https://twitter.com/Redvedev/status/1136051263148306439>)
21. ZoophileW/GuruminYT (@zoophilew.bsky.social/gurumin.bsky.social) has been seen interacting with Tarro on Twitter (<https://archive.today/jugl2>) and admitted to FluffyPaws, one of the people who runs the account, being a minor: (<https://archive.today/5380E>). They've also said they're "not going to get away from the zoo community": (<https://archive.today/aYIZL>)
22. Several people submitted to the Zoophile Mute List Form were implicated in or linked to the SnakeThing/Kero/Tane leaks. Here's a rundown of these people:

    1. Paradox Wolf (@ctcwired.paradoxwolf.info) tweeted about zoophilia several times from 2014 to 2017 (<https://archive.today/5IG26>), tweeted about being "an ally" in 2017: (<https://archive.today/ushQa>), and as far back as 2018 they had it in their AD's bio: (<https://archive.today/zgEg3>). They also condemned calling Kero a zoosadist: (<https://archive.today/ilWtO>). Additional screenshots of Paradox being an apologist for zoophilia: (<https://archive.today/4PQ0t>)
    2. Anubis Coyote (@yotepa.ws) was found liking explicit animal sexual abuse media from @olHowlnGrowl in 2023: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1676923144089784321>). He let a dog mount him before: _[CW for censored animal sexual abuse media.]_ (<https://twitter.com/Selenium_S/status/1043132390766518273>). He was also mentioned in the zoosadism leaks as being a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>) and follows Tekkita, Huskeee, Dire, Werel Wolf, Kieran, Nillow, Paradox Wolf, RubberAsylum, Tundru, Kit Fox, Cenny, and Akari. Additionally, he liked a post from open zoophile Huskeee about non-verbal communication (i.e., a way to justify them sexually abusing dogs): (<https://bsky.app/profile/huskeee.bsky.social/post/3k64xt47fdi24/liked-by>)
    3. Philly Satark (@purple-slutsky.com) was mentioned as being a zoophile in the zoosadism leaks: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). They were additionally found to have participated in another zoophile Telegram group: (<https://twitter.com/Mylunee/status/1235263582964715523>) The person who made their suit, jessefrost / frosstfursuits, openly associates with Cenny as well (this is a thread): (<https://twitter.com/carnalcove/status/1500755885081120770>).
    4. Sethpup (@sethpup.bsky.social) tweeted that they fantasized over zoophilia in 2012: (<https://twitter.com/SethPup/status/190577018621001728>), there's evidence of them drawing porn of their character raping a feral dog, (<https://twitter.com/fluffybluegurl/status/1288977837899362304>) and they've openly associated with Cenny: (<https://twitter.com/Dragoncatclem/status/1502734257063669766>)
    5. Stormy (@stormycat.xyz) has openly admitted to being a zoophile and having sex with animals: (<https://archive.today/jGTch>) and was named in the zoosadist leaks by SnakeThing: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). When they were called out on it in 2018, they downplayed what happened as "[watching] the community take a shit on you over what you did as a teenager" and said the fandom was toxic (<https://archive.today/Q2qMu>). In addition, Cenny defended Stormy publicly after Cenny was criticized for associating with him: (<https://archive.today/Lswki>)
    6. Tekkita (@ak1tap0wer.bsky.social) was implicated in the zoosadist leaks: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>) and was part of a plot to assault someone who pressed charges against their associates: (<https://dogpatch.press/2019/09/16/crime-ring-zoosadist>). Tekkita dated Cupid The Deer, a convicted pedophile and zoosadist: (<https://dogpatch.press/2021/10/04/zoosadist-cupid-conviction/>) He claimed he was going to borrow a dog from Cupid and discussed possessing "gorey rough videos" with known zoosadist SnakeThing: (<https://archive.today/Mcv6e>). Additionally, he was seen in 2019 hanging out with Akari, apparently his boyfriend at the time: (<https://twitter.com/forgifuzzbutt/status/1114218195907416065>) _[Tekkita's Bluesky account has since been deleted, but we've decided to keep this entry in the document since Tekkita is an important figure in the zoosadist leaks.]_
    7. Rai Dawg (@raidawghusky.bsky.social) is on record having dated Cupid The Deer, a convicted pedophile and zoosadist: (<https://dogpatch.press/2021/10/04/zoosadist-cupid-conviction/>). In 2022, he defended Cupid in court: (<https://archive.today/PGpA0>). Rai also posted a tweet involving Akari, a known zoophile: (<https://archive.today/9A5dt>)

       > In an earlier version of this document, we were of the opinion that Mr. Bitchtits was Rai, and another common theory in anti-zoophile circles was that Mr. Bitchtits was a shared account. However, external research instead confirmed that the person running the Mr. Bitchtits account arranged to make animal sexual abuse media, that there was a matching video of evidence including Tekkita's suit, and the date the file was created is the day after he discussed borrowing a dog from Cupid in the logs. Therefore, we've deduced that Tekkita is the sole owner of the account, _not_ Rai. However, due to his proximity to Cupid and other known zoophiles, Rai's staying on the list.

    8. postaldog94 (@postaldog94.bsky.social) is a registered sex offender who was mentioned as wanting to assault puppies with SnakeThing. These logs also connect him with Akari and Tekkita _[CW for NSFL conversations.]_ (<https://archive.today/J8KqY>).
    9. Affy/MilkDestroyer/PsychedelicSaber/AffyWolf/BigtittyTusky (@milkdestroyer.bsky.social) was named by SnakeThing as a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). Additionally, she was spotted interacting with another zoophile, Thylasaur: (<https://archive.today/5OIzX>). _[Proof of Thylasaur being a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/REFie>)]_
    10. Ruffa (@ruffa.bsky.social) was named by SnakeThing as a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). Additionally, there's logs of him discussing zoophilia from 2017: (<https://imgur.com/a/oe0yili>).
    11. KierenShep (@sheppy.gay) roomed with known zoosadist Tane at MFF: (<https://archive.today/GrBbE>) and his partner, CEOWolf (@ceowolf.bsky.social), lists Zoophilia as a "Yes" on his F-List: (<https://archive.today/YJsFF>).
    12. MoosePup (@moosepup.bsky.social) was named by Tane as a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/Hn6Eg>). He's also been photographed with Sheppfox: (<https://archive.today/pGcS3>).

    14. Ponyfox/Freckles/Darkwolf (@ponyfox.bsky.social) is a zoophile. He appeared on a Dutch television series about zoophilia in 2015. His face was censored in the episode, but he took and posted pictures with the camera crew anyway: (<https://archive.today/KZRhL>). He was also talked to SnakeThing in 2017: (<https://archive.today/2Fzxm>), said he was a zoophile as far back as 2012: (<https://archive.today/DZBUO>), and was active in a forum topic about zoophilia in 2007: (<https://archive.today/YJqw2>)
    15. YourMainParadox (@yourmainparadox.bsky.social) was named by SnakeThing as a zoophile, but was only publicly outed in late 2023: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1728682159874146713>). In the leaks, there are pictures of him and another person sexually abusing a dog: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1728682162998944075>). And the side, front, and back views of the suit line up with the suit in the pictures of the abuse, confirming it's him: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1728682169147777084> / <https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1728682171131646228>).

134. Hypnotist Sappho (@hypnotist-sappho.bsky.social) is an open zoophile and pedophile, but we believe this Bluesky account is LARPing as her. Here's why this account is on the list despite not being Sappho:

     > I was recently followed by this account and, initially, I was going to block them and list the account on the doc because of Sappho's well-known history as a zoophile and pedophile. At the time, they told me they used the username so Sappho couldn't claim the username in the event they tried to come back to the furry community, so we held off on adding them to the list for the time being. However, they recently deleted their clarification, effectively turning the account from a well-intentioned person squatting the username into a troll LARPing as a zoophile and pedophile: (<https://imgur.com/a/b5KwuEf>). Furthermore, they've made posts that said things like "rules were made to be broken (laws too)": (<https://imgur.com/a/UKEnGdp>), and they've made some arguably incendiary replies like "maybe I'm her, maybe I'm not, I'm not saying": (<https://imgur.com/a/WWogf62>). If you're going to squat a username so a bad actor can't take it, there should be some permanent, accessible notice that that's what you're doing; roleplaying as an outed zoophile and pedophile doesn't assist the movement in any way. There's a point where the bit goes too far and it starts becoming a problem instead of contributing to the movement. TLDR: We don't believe this is the real Sappho, but the fact that this account no longer has a clarification we can point to that explicitly says they're not the real Sappho can potentially lead to real harm and confusion.

On November 8th, 2023, she posted feral NSFW art of my fursona with a Greek zeta on the ass as a "thanks" for creating the mute list, which is sexual harassment: (<https://archive.today/0YoYQ>). She also alleged that I'm a "closeted bestialist" because I use IRL pictures of huskies to represent myself online: (<https://archive.today/U4lnn>). And in response to me saying she shouldn't use her trauma to say "furries _are_ zoophiles," and, if anything, that's why zoophiles are dangerous, she sent me Telegram messages where she literally hit the character limit saying I'm "targeting" her, when she's been harassing me for having her on the list: (<https://archive.today/uDD4F>). _[Thera's Bluesky accounts have since been deleted, but we've decided to keep this entry in the document since this context is important to certain events related to the mute list.]_

She also took a commission for Telegram stickers of WolfJLupus in 2018, even including a "zoo pride" sticker: (<https://twitter.com/ConStaffWatch/status/1742184670568034712>). _[For transparency's sake, we've archived the InkBunny page for the stickers on archive.today: (<https://archive.today/w0Ydf>)]_ And in 2020, she co-founded a virtual furry convention called FeralCon, which turned out to actively harbor zoophiles (read the whole thread): (<https://twitter.com/ConStaffWatch/status/1284268195877019650>).

He changed his username to JakeOwlsky at some point after this tweet was made.]_ As recently as November 2023, he was interacting with known zoosadist Tekkita's AD, even while no longer having the zeta symbol in his display name: (<https://twitter.com/JakeOwlsky/status/1720501099701137803>). With previously defending Nighty and being an open zoophile just two years ago (and currently being followed by several zoophiles on Twitter), we're comfortable putting him on the list.

Someone in Xy's Telegram group chat reached out to us with the knowledge that the zoophile in question joined, introduced herself in the chat saying Xy vouched for her, and was promptly kicked because of the zeta in her bio.

261. Ollie/ArtsyPawz (@artsypawz.bsky.social/@kaitalking.bsky.social) interacts with and supports open zoophiles. In addition to interacting with people who openly identify as zoophiles, they've also suggested multiple times across multiple accounts that people who identify as zoophiles are not abusers, spanning as far back as September of 2023. We believe that while paraphiles aren't inherently abusers, participating in the wider community enables a larger cycle of abuse, even in the case of open zoophiles who consider themselves anti-contact. Paraphiles with these attractions should seek therapy from people specialized in working with paraphilias, not in communities which normalize abuse. Full statement from the mute list team with screenshots of evidence: (<https://bsky.app/profile/heika.dog/post/3kutbudbvj27f>).
