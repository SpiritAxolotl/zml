# Zoophile Mute List: Information & Evidence

## Information

This mute list automatically mutes zoophiles and people who actively interact with them. Go to <https://zmlform.heika.dog> to submit someone to the list or request to be removed.

_[All relevant links to evidence have been archived on https://archive.today in the event that they go down or change for any reason. Bluesky links are unable to be archived at this time due to requiring a login.]_

Some terms need to be defined for the mute list, so here are some useful definitions:

- "Actively interacting with zoophiles" includes but is not limited to: liking posts relating to, replying to, following, or otherwise explicitly advocating for zoophilia.
  - For instance, simply following or occasionally interacting with someone who's been accused of being a zoophile is not enough to be put on this list; following a large amount of zoophiles, actively interacting with an account which posts content of animals being sexually abused, or directly supporting posts relating to zoophilia is. (If I happen to send you evidence that your mutual is a zoophile and you block me, that is not enough to warrant putting you on the list either.) These stipulations prevent innocent people from being unfairly put on the mute list, as I'm aware these are serious accusations which can ruin a person's reputation and should not be taken lightly.
- "Known" zoophiles are people who were outed as zoophiles, while "open" zoophiles embrace the label‚Äîthese terms are not interchangeable.

To be added to the mute list, candidates should meet at least one of these criteria:

1. Anyone who actively interacts with zoophiles, follows a large amount of zoophiles, or is otherwise evidently a zoophile. This includes indicators like having the zeta symbol (Œ∂) in their bio, or having a handle that's linked to an explicitly zoophile-centric domain name, like \*.zoo.wtf, \*.zoo.and.me, or \*.zooey.pub.
2. Anyone that has been publicly exposed by a whistleblower for actively interacting with or being a zoophile. This includes alternate accounts, if applicable.
3. People who are found to make spaces that openly welcome zoophiles, or are otherwise found to participate in conversations which advocate for or admit to zoophilic acts.
4. Artists who draw feral NSFW art and their supporters will not be added unless there is evidence they actively interact with or are zoophiles. While I don't support NSFW feral art, this mute list is intended to expose people who have been found to support or facilitate harm done against real animals. Despite zoophiles continually using the label as a cover, therians are also not added by default under this same stipulation.

You can submit people to the list, request to be removed from the list, or submit feedback for the list or this document here: <https://zmlform.heika.dog>.

People who are added to the mute list will have a disclaimer below their profile that says "Muted by Zoophile Mute List." To use this mute list, select the button at the top that says "Subscribe." (On mobile devices, this button may say "Subscribe & Mute.") To share this list, select the arrow to the right of the Subscribe button.

Subscribing to this list does not automatically block the people on it; you must do this yourself.

## Evidence

**Content warning:** Many of these links include censored, but still explicit bestiality content‚Äîproceed with caution.

1. (There were other furries in this thread, but I'll only be focusing on the people on the mute list with Bluesky accounts. Assume fully censored or blacked-out screenshots in the thread to be explicit bestiality content; these are not blank tweets.)

   - On July 2nd, 2023, Cael (@cael.tech/@cael.gay), Abra Heron (@abra.anthro.place/@abra.sheath.pics), and Brick (@doggy.ws/@ad.doggy.ws) were all implicated in following and actively interacting with a zoophile, privated Twitter user @olHowlnGrowl. According to whistleblower @ExposeTheFV, this account only posts explicit bestiality content. (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675482183040131072>)
   - The zoophile in question directly encourages and supports bestiality, even going so far as to post a video of the act, a post which Brick was screenshotted as liking on their AD. (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675482185586069504>) The year of the post is partially obscured in the original screenshot, but according to @ExposeTheFV in a separate reply, this video was posted on June 29th, 2023. (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1676923144089784321>)
   - Abra liked bestiality content with the caption "Huskies ‚ô• üåπ" (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675482187855175681>). Both Cael and Abra liked a post which, to put it delicately, applied a sexual innuendo represented by filling a donut with cream to animals at FWA 2023. (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675482190069760000>)
   - Cael liked a post from the zoophile complaining about "the account with the good dog \*\*\*\* photos" getting suspended.‚Äù (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1675482190069760000>)

2. _[CW for realistic depictions of animal genitalia and explicit nudes. The Telegram link provided here also has screen recordings of select tweets in addition to screenshots.]_
   AkariHusky has a large amount of evidence against him, most of which can be viewed here if you have Telegram: (<https://t.me/AkariHuskyZoophile>) Along with directly supporting zoophilia and being an open zoophile for years, Akari also had an AD dedicated to his dog where he posted explicit bestiality content of the dog. In 2015, he said in a reply that he "wouldn't wish being zoo upon anyone," direct confirmation that he is a zoophile.
3. _[CW in the first link for explicit nudes. Bestiality content is censored.]_
   Among a mountain of other accusations like calling the act of holding people accountable for zoophilia an "SJW crusade" and liking a post on his AD which linked to a peer-to-peer mirror of bestiality content in 2013 (<https://twitter.com/itsjustathingy/status/1406230343426977793>), Cenny (@cenny.bsky.social/@cennyad.bsky.social) had the zeta symbol in his bio in 2016 (<https://twitter.com/cennyarchive/status/1566884973440811009>) and was caught liking explicit bestiality content on his AD (<https://twitter.com/cennyarchive/status/1566885691170197504>). In addition, he was explicitly mentioned as a zoophile in the zoosadism leaks in 2017: (<https://archive.today/zlA4O>).
4. Tarro (@tarro.zooey.pub) is an open zoophile. They were recently seen interacting with Akari: (<https://bsky.app/profile/tarro.zooey.pub/post/3k3cx4o7iz52h>). Papa Rhino (@paparhino.dad), Soren (@owlkin.art), Lukar (@lukar.feral.army), Knotty Racc Gurl (@kraccgurl.bsky.social), and Thera (@thera.pw) were all seen interacting with Tarro's posts and other people on the mute list, including one trying to find more zoophiles: (<https://bsky.app/profile/hereforthezoo.bsky.social/post/3k3ctzwnei52g>).
5. In addition to interacting with Tarro, Papa Rhino (@paparhino.dad), as of this writing, runs a public zoophile Twitter account which hosts explicit pictures of IRL horse genitalia, and likes replies where their followers sexualize the horse. I'm not kidding when I say the reason I knew this was them is because they had their main account in the website section of their bio. Their Twitter is ZooeyDonk, but I don't encourage looking at it, so I won't link it directly.

   > Update on August 2nd, 2023: The account linked their main in their bio again, so I‚Äôve archived it in its current state on archive.today. Censored screenshot: (<https://bsky.app/profile/heika.dog/post/3k4wynlvtda2v>). Presumably in response to my public callout, the account‚Äôs username has since been updated to @ZooeyDonk. It is the same account. A (censored for privacy) DM conversation where they confirm they‚Äôre @Papa\_Rhino\_ (formerly @chrispywolf, as shown in this screenshot): (<https://archive.today/QrF5z)>)

   > Update on August 30th, 2023: There's also a recently made Bluesky account for ZooeyDonk (@zooeydonk.bsky.social). ~~It has yet to post anything, but with the precedent of zoo.pics getting suspended, we expect them to get taken down if they post anything like that.~~ They've apparently confirmed that they won't post explicit bestiality content on Bluesky due to them not allowing it. Will update if they do anything really weird.

6. Soren (@owlkin.art) currently identifies as a ‚Äúzootherian‚Äù on their public channels, including Bluesky: (<https://bsky.app/profile/owlkin.art>) and follows several open zoophiles like Akito, Alder, Aspen, Aster, Brass, DotaWolf, Heart Chee, Kane, Matuska, PossBeans, Toggle, and Vex (but even with that list, they're following way more from the mute list): (<https://bsky.app/profile/owlkin.art/follows>)
7. Kaptain (@kaptain.dog) was found openly harboring zoophiles in a DM and called people holding zoophiles accountable "a witch hunt," in addition to interacting with Cenny's AD. (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1442165316608479232>)
8. Huskeee (@huskeee.bsky.social) and Zoobydoobydoo (@zoobydoobydoo.bsky.social) are both open zoophiles who requested to be put on the list: (1: <https://bsky.app/profile/huskeee.bsky.social/post/3k3pdbw7hvw2d> / 2: <https://bsky.app/profile/zoobydoobydoo.bsky.social/post/3k3txqk7kz72y>)
9. Zena O‚ÄôBrien (@zenamobrien.bsky.social) tweeted about wishing to have sex with a horse in 2021: (<https://bsky.app/profile/the984.bsky.social/post/3k3wp3usva62i>)
10. Akito (@akito.zooand.me) hosts a zoophile podcast and self-identifies as a zoophile, interacting with several people on the mute list: (<https://bsky.app/profile/akito.zooand.me/post/3k46ghzxyqs22>).
11. ~~ZooFur Faction (@zoo.pics) posts explicit images of IRL animal genitalia.~~ We‚Äôve gotten this account taken down. To anyone who reported them or shared a post calling for them to be reported, thank you! üéâ
12. 007bistromath (@007bistromath.bsky.social), The Dog Queen (@interestedknot.bsky.social), Ceres Fallen (@ceresfallen.bsky.social), and Akkuriss (@akkuriss.bsky.social) all frequently interact with people on this list and/or openly identify as zoophiles themselves.
13. Tundru (@tundru.bsky.social) frequently interacts with Cenny, a known zoophile: (<https://twitter.com/Tundru_DireWolf/status/1406032710401892360>) and has been seen deflecting confrontations about the behavior of other known zoophiles to conversations about feral porn when the actual conversation is not strictly about that. For context: the user in question, while not having a Bluesky account that I‚Äôm aware of, commissioned porn of their dog being sexually abused by their OC. In this instance, this is distinguishable from normal feral porn because it explicitly referenced a real-life dog. (<https://twitter.com/Sweet_clawz/status/1620104867934273537>)
14. Tarminac (@tarminac.bsky.social) identifies as a ‚Äúzoosexual,‚Äù also having a zeta symbol in their display name. In addition, several people on the mute list like Soren and The Dog Queen liked a post of theirs: (Post: <https://bsky.app/profile/tarminac.bsky.social/post/3k52dwgxto52g> / Likes: <https://bsky.app/profile/tarminac.bsky.social/post/3k52dwgxto52g/liked-by>)
15. Toggle (@toggle.zoo.wtf), Puppyboi (@st1ckyp4rts.bsky.social), Zedderchee (@zedderchee.bsky.social), Ginfossa (@ginfossa.bsky.social), and Dotawolf (@dotawolf.bsky.social) all publicly list themselves as zoophiles on Bluesky or Twitter.
16. BirtyFur (@birtyfur.bsky.social) not only frequently draws profile picture commissions for zoophiles (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1684853358593798144>), but he‚Äôs also been seen following and interacting with them on Twitter as well: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1685040396236451840>).
17. Simba, the owner of furry community Discord server Furry Valley (@furryvalley.bsky.social), is a documented zoosadist (<https://twitter.com/FENNERGY/status/1211658141701722112>) and has been found following zoophiles on the main Furry Valley Twitter as recently as 2021: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1405775747818557442>). And it didn't take me long to find that they're still following zoophiles on the main Twitter account as of August 21st, 2023, even with Elon Twitter not letting people see an account‚Äôs full following anymore. (It's out of the scope of the mute list, but it should be noted that he's also a documented pedophile and took advantage of at-risk LGBTQ+ youth.)
18. In a Telegram message from 2017, Rayne (no Bluesky account as of this writing; their Twitter is <https://twitter.com/FoxRayne13>) admitted to sexually abusing and killing live fish with their partner Teriyakii (@teriyaki.bsky.social) as ‚Äúa kink:‚Äù (<https://twitter.com/soulsmooothie/status/1693746660466135181>) Both have since privated their accounts. Video proof that the messages are real: (<https://twitter.com/soulsmooothie/status/1693905674227331228>)
19. Matsuka (@matsuka.bsky.social) has publicly stated they don't condone IRL zoophilia on their feral account, but they were seen listing themselves as a zoophile in 2019: (<https://twitter.com/Redvedev/status/1136051263148306439>)
20. ZoophileW/FluffyPaws (@zoophilew.bsky.social) has been seen interacting with Tarro on Twitter (<https://twitter.com/ZoophilesW/status/1692698639573950759>) and admitted to FluffyPaws being a minor: (<https://twitter.com/ZoophilesW/status/1692899545280127346>). They've said they're "not going to get away from the zoo community": (<https://twitter.com/FluffyPawbs1/status/1693029535862726979>)
21. Several people submitted to the Zoophile Mute List Form were implicated in or linked to the zoosadism/Kero leaks. Here's a rundown of these people:
    - Paradox Wolf (@ctcwired.paradoxwolf.info) tweeted about zoophilia several times from 2014 to 2017 (<https://imgur.com/a/fXsw7np>), tweeted about being "an ally" in 2017: (<https://archive.today/ushQa>), and as far back as 2018 they had it in their AD's bio: (<https://archive.today/zgEg3>). They also condemned calling Kero a zoosadist: (<https://archive.today/ilWtO>)
    - Anubis Coyote (@yotepa.ws) was found liking explicit bestiality content from @olHowlnGrowl in 2023: (<https://twitter.com/ExposeTheFV/status/1676923144089784321>). He let a dog mount him before: _[CW for censored explicit bestiality content.]_ (<https://twitter.com/Selenium_S/status/1043132390766518273>). He was also mentioned in the zoosadism leaks as being a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>) and follows Tekkita, Huskeee, Dire, Werel Wolf, Kieran, Nillow, Paradox Wolf, Rubber Asylum, Tundru, October Tiger, Kit Fox, Cenny, and Akari: (<https://bsky.app/profile/yotepa.ws/follows>). Additionally, he liked a post from open zoophile Huskeee about non-verbal communication (i.e., a way to justify them sexually abusing dogs): (<https://bsky.app/profile/huskeee.bsky.social/post/3k64xt47fdi24/liked-by>)
    - Philly Satark (@purple-slutsky.com) was mentioned as being a zoophile in the zoosadism leaks: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). They were additionally found to have participated in another zoophile Telegram group: (<https://twitter.com/Mylunee/status/1235263582964715523>) The person who made their suit, jessefrost / frosstfursuits, openly associates with Cenny as well (this is a thread): (<https://twitter.com/carnalcove/status/1500755885081120770>).
    - Sethpup (@sethpup.bsky.social) tweeted that they fantasized over zoophilia in 2012: (<https://twitter.com/SethPup/status/190577018621001728>), there's evidence of them drawing porn of their character raping a feral dog, (<https://twitter.com/fluffybluegurl/status/1288977837899362304>) and they've openly associated with Cenny: (<https://twitter.com/Dragoncatclem/status/1502734257063669766>)
    - Stormy (@stormycat.xyz) has openly admitted to being a zoophile and having sex with animals: (<https://archive.today/jGTch>) and was named in the zoosadist leaks by SnakeThing: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). When they were called out on it in 2018, they downplayed what happened as "[watching] the community take a shit on you over what you did as a teenager" and said the fandom was toxic (<https://archive.today/Q2qMu>). In addition, Cenny defended Stormy publicly after Cenny was criticized for associating with him: (<https://archive.today/Lswki>)
    - Dire (@direprophecies.bsky.social) was implicated as a zoophile in Telegram messages and was pictured hanging out with Akari and several other zoophiles at a ski meet: (<https://twitter.com/ConStaffWatch/status/1399573940054347778>)
    - Tekkita (@ak1tap0wer.bsky.social) was implicated in the zoosadist leaks: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>) and was part of a plot to assault someone who pressed charges against their associates: (<https://dogpatch.press/2019/09/16/crime-ring-zoosadist>). Tekkita dated Cupid The Deer, a convicted pedophile and zoosadist: (<https://dogpatch.press/2021/10/04/zoosadist-cupid-conviction/>) He claimed he was going to borrow a dog from Cupid and discussed possessing "gorey rough videos" with known zoosadist SnakeThing: (<https://archive.today/Mcv6e>). Additionally, he was seen in 2019 hanging out with Akari, apparently his boyfriend at the time: (<https://twitter.com/forgifuzzbutt/status/1114218195907416065>)
    - Rai Dawg (@raidawghusky.bsky.social) is on record having dated Cupid The Deer, a convicted pedophile and zoosadist: (<https://dogpatch.press/2021/10/04/zoosadist-cupid-conviction/>). In 2022, he defended Cupid in court: (<https://archive.today/PGpA0>). Rai also posted a tweet involving Akari, a known zoophile: (<https://archive.today/9A5dt>)

    > In an earlier version of this document, we were of the opinion that Mr. Bitchtits was Rai, and another common theory in anti-zoophile circles was that Mr. Bitchtits was a shared account. However, external research instead confirmed that the person running the Mr. Bitchtits account arranged to make animal sexual abuse content, that there was a matching video of evidence including Tekkita's suit, and the date the file was created is the day after he discussed borrowing a dog from Cupid in the logs. Therefore, we've deduced that Tekkita is the sole owner of the account, *not* Rai. However, due to his proximity to Cupid and other known zoophiles, Rai's staying on the list.

    - postaldog94 (@postaldog94.bsky.social) is a registered sex offender who was mentioned as wanting to assault puppies with SnakeThing in the zoosadist leaks. These logs also connect him with Akari and Tekkita _[CW for NSFL conversations.]_ (<https://archive.today/J8KqY>).
    - MilkDestroyer/PsychedelicSaber/AffyWolf/BigtittyTusky (@milkdestroyer.bsky.social) was named by SnakeThing as a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). Additionally, she was spotted interacting with another zoophile, Thylasaur: (<https://archive.today/5OIzX>). _[Proof of Thylasaur being a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/REFie>)]_
    - Ruffa (@ruffa.bsky.social) was named by SnakeThing as a zoophile: (<https://archive.today/TeC8L>). Additionally, there's logs of him discussing zoophilia from 2017: (<https://imgur.com/a/oe0yili>).
    - Foxbearance/FoxB (@foxb.bsky.social) is a known zoophile who was outed in the zoosadism leaks. He was also filmed having sex with a horse in suit: _[CW for censored explicit bestiality content.]_ (<https://archive.today/Pe6E4>). The suit from the video lines up with an archived EuroFurence fursuits page from 2015: (<https://archive.today/VaVJD>). Additionally, he follows known zoophiles and zoophile sympathizers like Akari, Cenny, and RubberAsylum: (<https://bsky.app/profile/foxb.bsky.social/follows>)

145. Hypnotist Sappho (@hypnotist-sappho.bsky.social) is an open zoophile and pedophile, but we believe this Bluesky account is LARPing as her. Here's why this account is on the list despite not being Sappho:
> I was recently followed by this account and, initially, I was going to block them and list the account on the doc because of Sappho's well-known history as a zoophile and pedophile. At the time, they told me they used the username so Sappho couldn't claim the username in the event they tried to come back to the furry community, so we held off on adding them to the list for the time being. However, they recently deleted their clarification, effectively turning the account from a well-intentioned person squatting the username into a troll LARPing as a zoophile and pedophile: (<https://imgur.com/a/b5KwuEf>). Furthermore, they've made posts that said things like "rules were made to be broken (laws too)": (<https://imgur.com/a/UKEnGdp>), and they've made some arguably incendiary replies like "maybe I'm her, maybe I'm not, I'm not saying": (<https://imgur.com/a/WWogf62>). If you're going to squat a username so a bad actor can't take it, there should be some permanent, accessible notice that that's what you're doing; roleplaying as an outed zoophile and pedophile doesn't assist the movement in any way. There's a point where the bit goes too far and it starts becoming a problem instead of contributing to the movement. TLDR: We don't believe this is the real Sappho, but the fact that this account no longer has a clarification we can point to that explicitly says they're not the real Sappho can potentially lead to real harm and confusion.
146. Rot (@r0tnch0rd.bsky.social) is an open zoophile.
