# Zoophile Mute List GitHub Repo

This is the current home of the Zoophile Mute List, a mute list for Bluesky that automatically mutes zoophiles and people who actively interact with them. This README serves as a directory of sorts, so everything associated with the list is readily accessible. Navigate using the links below.

- [View and subscribe to the mute list.](https://bsky.app/profile/heika.dog/lists/3k3eg23h7ko2i)

People who are added to the mute list will have a disclaimer below their profile that says "Muted by Zoophile Mute List." To use this mute list, select the button at the top that says "Subscribe." (On mobile devices, this button may say "Subscribe & Mute.") To share this list, select the arrow to the right of the Subscribe button.

Subscribing to this list does not automatically block the people on it; you must do this yourself.

Because there's already a form to submit accounts to the list, don't submit them as an issue or pull request; submit them at <https://zmlform.heika.dog> instead so your response is kept confidential. Only submit an issue or pull request if you have a suggestion or fix for this GitHub repo itself.
