# Zoophile Mute List GitHub Repo

This is the current home of the Zoophile Mute List, which is composed of zoophiles and people who actively interact with them. This README serves as a directory of sorts, so everything associated with the list is readily accessible. Navigate using the links below.

- [View and subscribe to the mute list.](https://bsky.app/profile/heika.dog/lists/3k3eg23h7ko2i)
To mute or block the accounts on the list, select "Subscribe" at the upper-right corner of the page for the list.

When you subscribe to the list, accounts on the list will have a disclaimer below their profile that says they're muted or blocked by the list. To share this list, select the arrow to the right of the Subscribe button.

## Directory

- [Read the evidence.](zml.md)

- [Submit someone to the list, request to be removed, or submit feedback.](https://zmlform.heika.dog)

Because there's already a form to submit accounts to the list and request to be removed, don't submit them as an issue or pull request; submit them at <https://zmlform.heika.dog> instead so your response is kept confidential. Only submit an issue or pull request if you have a suggestion or fix for this GitHub repo itself.
